# Online File Creation and Editing with Google Docs

Although you can 
[create](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-2/adding-files-to-a-document-library#using-the-add-menu) 
and 
[edit](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-2/checking-out-and-editing-files) 
files by uploading them to and downloading them from your site's Documents and 
Media Library, @product@ doesn't contain a UI that lets you author or edit 
documents directly inside the portal. You can, however, create and edit files 
online in Google Docs. The articles in this section explain how to do this. 

Note that when you use Google Docs to create or edit a file in the Documents and 
Media Library, your file isn't permanently stored in Google Docs. Google Docs is 
only used for its editing UI. Your edits are then saved to the Documents and 
Media Library.
