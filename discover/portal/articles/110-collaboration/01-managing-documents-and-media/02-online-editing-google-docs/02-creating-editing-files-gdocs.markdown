# Creating and Editing Files with Google Docsâ„¢ [](id=creating-and-editing-files-with-google-docs)

The Documents and Media Library lets you use Google Docs&trade; to create and 
edit text documents, spreadsheets, or presentations. When you finish your 
editing session, your changes are automatically saved in the Documents and Media 
Library. This article contains instructions on these topics:

-   [Creating Files](#creating-files)
-   [Editing Files](#editing-files)
-   [Multiple Editing Sessions](#multiple-editing-sessions)

## Creating Files [](id=creating-files)

Follow these steps to create a new Documents and Media file via Google 
Docs&trade;:

1.  Open the *Menu* 
    (![Product Menu](../../../../images/icon-menu.png)), 
    click your site's name, and navigate to *Content* &rarr; 
    *Documents and Media*. 

2.  Click the *Add* icon 
    (![Add](../../../../images/icon-add.png)) 
    and select the type of Google document to add to the Document Library. You 
    can select the following:

    -   Google Docs&trade; Document
    -   Google Docs&trade; Presentation
    -   Google Docs&trade; Spreadsheet

    When you select one of these options, @product@ creates a temporary 
    Documents and Media file and links it to a new Google Docs&trade; file. Your 
    browser then redirects you to that Google Docs&trade; file so you can create 
    its content. 

    Note that some actions on the temporary Documents and Media file can affect 
    its linked Google Docs&trade; file. For more information, see the section 
    below on 
    [multiple editing sessions](#multiple-editing-sessions).

3.  Use the Google Docs&trade; editor to create your document's content. All 
    Google Docs&trade; features are available except for sharing. 

4.  Save or discard your changes by clicking one of these toolbar buttons in 
    Google Docs&trade;: 

    -   **Save and Return to Liferay:** Saves your document as a new file in the 
        Documents and Media Library, deletes the Google Docs&trade; file, and 
        returns you to the portal. The saved file's format depends on the type 
        of Google Document you selected in step two above: 

        -   Google Docs&trade; Document: Microsoft Word (`.docx`)
        -   Google Docs&trade; Presentation: Microsoft PowerPoint (`.pptx`)
        -   Google Docs&trade; Spreadsheet: Microsoft Excel (`.xlsx`)

    -   **Discard Changes:** Returns you to the portal without saving your file 
        in the Documents and Media Library or Google Docs&trade;. 

    Note that it's also possible to close the Google Docs&trade; window without 
    clicking either button. In this case, the editing session remains open even 
    though the window that displayed it is closed. For more information, see the 
    section below on 
    [multiple editing sessions](#multiple-editing-sessions).

## Editing Files [](id=editing-files)

You can use Google Docs&trade; to edit existing Documents and Media files. The 
Documents and Media Library currently lets you edit the following file types in 
Google Docs: 

-   Plain text documents
-   LibreOffice documents
-   XML-based Microsoft Office documents (`.docx`, `.pptx`, `.xlsx`). Note that 
    Google Docs&trade; doesn't support older Microsoft Office file types 
    (`.doc`, `.ppt`, `.xls`). 

Follow these steps to edit a Documents and Media file in Google Docs&trade;: 

1.  Navigate to the file in the Documents and Media Library. 

2.  Click the file's Actions icon 
    (![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) 
    and select *Edit in Google Docs*. This automatically 
    [checks out](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-2/checking-out-and-editing-files) 
    the file, transfers its content to a new Google Docs&trade; file, and 
    redirects you to that Google Docs&trade; file. 

    ![Figure 3: Select *Edit in Google Docs* from the file's Actions menu.](../../../../images/google-docs-edit.png)

3.  Edit the file in Google Docs&trade;. The editing process is exactly the same 
    as described above for creating files. 

## Multiple Editing Sessions [](id=multiple-editing-sessions)

When you create or edit a Documents and Media file in Google Docs&trade;, you 
can save or discard your changes by clicking *Save and Return to Liferay* or 
*Discard Changes*, respectively. But what if you instead close the Google 
Docs&trade; window without clicking either? Don't worry---this won't tear the 
fabric of spacetime. Because you didn't explicitly save or discard your changes, 
you can access them via the original Documents and Media file. If this file 
didn't exist before (e.g., you were creating a new file), it appears in 
Documents and Media as a temporary file. 

The following actions are available via the Documents and Media file's Actions 
icon 
(![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)): 

-   **Edit in Google Docs:** Resume editing the file in Google Docs&trade;. 

-   **Check in:** Saves the Google Docs&trade; file (including any changes) to 
    the Documents and Media file, then deletes Google Docs&trade; file. This is 
    equivalent to clicking *Save and Return to Liferay* in a Google Docs&trade; 
    editing session. 

-   **Cancel Checkout:** Deletes the Google Docs&trade; file, discarding any 
    changes. This is equivalent to clicking *Discard Changes* in a Google 
    Docs&trade; editing session.
